// Order of operators in JS is same with JAVA
console.log(4 + 4 * -1 - 8 / 2);
// assignment operator
let x = 5;
x += 5;
console.log(x); //10

// comparison: similar to Java. But there is some diff points

let one = 1;
let one2 = 1;

let one_str = "1";
let one_str2 = "2";

console.log(one == one2); //looking value
console.log(one_str == one_str2);
console.log(one == one_str); //looking value
console.log(one === one_str); //looking value and data type together

//logical operators same like Java. We have only short circuit &&(and), ||(or) operators
//control flow statements same as Java. if-else/switch/break/continue
//ternary operators same as Java
//Loops (while and for) same as Java
